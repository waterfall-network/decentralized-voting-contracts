# Decentralized Governance: Decision-Making Based on Voting

## Description

Our purpose is to develop approaches to decision-making in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) systems and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and the formation of token-curated ranked registries (TCRRs) through voting.

### Two Alternatives

We propose a procedure for choosing one of two alternatives, in which the voter does not just mark the chosen alternative but indicates their level of support for each of the alternatives, which is then taken into account when determining the winning alternative. This procedure prevents the loss of the opinion of those voters who practically do not like any of the alternatives. Also, it determines the overall level of support for each alternative. This rule can be easily applied to voting with a large number of voters.

### Borda Procedure

The classic Borda preferential procedure requires the voter to perform a comparison of all alternatives and to construct a ranking that does not allow for indifference to the candidates. The considered procedure can be applied to selecting one alternative out of several. Also, it makes it possible to choose several best alternatives, because, after applying this procedure, we get a collective rating of alternatives that takes into account the entire depth of the voting profiles. In this case, the problem of scalability and the problem of the duration of voters' ratings are avoided. 

### Token-curated Ranked Registries

The Borda procedure also allows us to expand the functionality of the token-curated registry (TCR), since the candidate options can be sorted in descending order of points scored. Therefore, from the resulting list, one can select the required number of best alternatives and publish them as a ranked list of token-curated ranked registries (TCRRs).
